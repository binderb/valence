# Valence

Unity project featuring an interactive challenge where intro chemistry students can build and discover molecules. Written in C# and designed for web deployment.

## Background

The initial version of this project was built in 2015, during my first year of university teaching. It was my first successful deployment of an independently-developed, interactive teaching tool to a live classroom environment. This version is the latest stable release, deployed in 2017.

Project code is currently stored here without the necessary art assets, but a fully functional deployed version is available in my portfolio (see below!). I hope to return to this project someday to update it with modern sprite handling tools and better web integration.

## Usage

For now, this repository is an archive for the legacy code, and is not very portable. Still, it may be interesting to peruse in its current state.

A deployed instance of this app can be found [here](https://binderlab.org/resources/valence_1_9_8). The game is best experienced on a full-fledged web browser; mobile support is currently limited.
